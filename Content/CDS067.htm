            <MadCap:keyword term="CDS063" />This program is called by the error routine, CDS063, to
expand any full data files. It will also create overflow files when a spool file
fills.&#160; This routine is rarely required any more since most file are
defined as dynamic and will expand to the limits of the disc drive or file
system.</p>
        <p>Calling Format:</p>
        <p><code>CALL "CDS067",D,D$</code>
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th colspan="2">CDS067</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>D</td>
                <td>is only passed to CDS067 when you know the device number of the full
 file. If it is not passed to CDS067, or passed as zero, CDS067 will attempt
 to determine the device number of the full file.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>D$</td>
                <td>is information used by the error routine, CDS063, to record the file
 expansion details on the error log.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Although this routine is usually only called by the error routine, it can be
used to expand any full file. If a program does not have sufficient memory, or
is not interfaced to the error routine, you may have sufficient memory to expand
the file by typing in console mode: CALL "CDS067",X where X is the device number
of the full file. Note that CDS067 can only expand files completely full.</p>
