        <p class="SectionDesc">This program can be used to copy/append and/or delete window 
based text created with the W type option of <a href="CDS069.htm">CDS069</a>. It 
is strongly suggested that you use this routine to copy or delete window based 
text, since there are data structure changes planned to support new features of 
window based text. Hardcoded logic to copy or delete may fail when these new 
features are implemented.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="File Utility" />Window Text is also frequently called Notepad text.</p>
        <p>Due to the structure of window text files, you cannot simply move the file 
using the File Utility when it becomes necessary to increase the text ID size or 
the characters per record. Instead, define the new file with the keysize and 
characters per record required, then use CDS054 to transfer the data to the new 
file.</p>
        <p>Window text files use multiple records to store text. Each record has a 
single character suffix, in addition to the text ID. This limits the text for 
each text ID to be 256 records.&#160; Window text files can be defined with any 
characters per record, but the characters per record will limit the total size 
of the text.&#160; For most text files, setting the characters per record to 128 
will provide for over 250 lines of text with some use of attributes (bold, 
underline, etc.).&#160; In some cases, the text might require more than 250 
lines, in which case you would set the characters per record to 256, 512, 1024 
or even larger.</p>
