        <p class="SectionDesc">This program can be run or called to provide file maintenance for files described in the Data Dictionary.&#160; File Maintenance applications provide the ability for users to add, modify, delete, and view records from data files. Each File Maintenance includes at least one Standard View, but frequently also includes additional Views.&#160; The data file must be defined using <a href="http://excellware.com/docs/dynamo/FMS/cdf130.htm">Data Dictionary Maintenance</a> (FMS).&#160; The Views must be defined using the <a href="http://excellware.com/docs/dynamo/FMS/xxdd20.htm">Views</a> Option of Data Dictionary Maintenance (FMS). The Views to be included in the File Maintenance are specified in the <a href="http://excellware.com/docs/dynamo/FMS/xxdd22.htm">File Maintenance</a> Option of Data Dictionary Maintenance (FMS).	CDS028 can also be used in 'inquiry only mode' where records can be 
	displayed but not modified, added, nor deleted.&#160; Inquiry only mode is 
	also enabled when the user does not have write permissions to the primary 
	data file.</p>
        <p> CDS028 is typically RUN from the menu; however, applications can also RUN or CALL CDS028 as needed.&#160; 
</p>
        <p>When CDS028 is run, the following variables are used.&#160; All other variables are cleared.&#160; The Data Dictionary company code and Data Dictionary File Name are derived from <code>Y.APPID$</code>.&#160; <code>Y.VDTSFX$</code> is used for the File Maintenance VDT Suffix.&#160; When the user exits, the Dynamo menu CDS001 will be run.</p>
        <p>CDS028 is also run from the Dynamo menu when the menu selection type is 
	set to "F" for File Maintenance.&#160; In most cases, the data file to be 
	maintained can be determined by the Application ID.&#160; When the data file 
	name does not match the data dictionary file name, you can specify the data 
	file name as File 1 in <a href="http://www.excellware.com/docs/dynamo/SMU/CDS880.htm">Menu Maintenance</a>.</p>
        <p>Effective with CDS028 dated 02/24/14 or later, if the record has changed, it will be written to disc on multiple-view maintenance whenever the user selects a view option. This ensures that any routine that reads the record from disc will always have the latest version of the record.</p>

	presented with the option to 'Select existing record from list'.&#160; This

	Maintenance Configuration (FMS).&#160; Search capabilities also exist to 
	allow the user to select a record based on an entered search argument.</p>
        <p>If the primary key to the data file only has a single value, then the key
