            <MadCap:keyword term="Page Logic" />This routine should be used by all print jobs both at the start of a new page, and 
	when necessary to close the printer channel before returning to the menu, or 
	by applications that do not return to the Dynamo Tools menu program CDS001.&#160; It handles all new page logic, printing reports to the display, and special end-of-job logic.&#160; 
	It also works with all supported printer devices including dot matrix 
	printers, laser/inkjet printers, printing to the display (both 80 and 132 
	column display types), faxing, printing to a file, printing to a PDF file, emailing 
	text, emailing PDF files as attachments, 
	as well as printing in portrait or landscape mode.&#160; If you use CDS094, 
	then no additional logic is required within the application program to 
	handle printing to the display, or other special output device.</p>
        <h5>New Page Logic</h5>
        <p>In the NEWPAGE routine of any program that prints, call CDS094 before printing anything to the page.&#160; 
	There should be no <code>'FF'</code> mnemonics anywhere in the application program.&#160; 
	CDS094 will print the <code>'FF'</code> when applicable.&#160; </p>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; <code>CALL "CDS094",Y6$</code></p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Form Feed" />In most circumstances, you want to send a form feed to the printer when starting a new page, except on the very first page.&#160; CDS094 will handle this for you, and take into account any fax cover page that may have been printed.&#160; This prevents a blank page at the beginning of each report.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="ArrowRt" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="ArrowLf" />When printing to the display, CDS094 will prompt the operator to continue, so the display can be cleared to display the next page.&#160; The operator is also given an F2 choice to continue without prompting for each page, and an F4 option to abort the job and return to the menu processor.&#160; CDS094 also changes the display to 132 column mode when the report requires more than 80 columns and the display device supports 132 column mode.&#160; If the display device does not support 132 column mode, then the new page prompt will allow the user to slide the view window to view either the leftmost 80 or rightmost 80 columns of the report using the ArrowLf &amp; ArrowRt keys.</p>
        <p>When printing to a file, CDS094 will not send the form feed to the file.</p>
        <p>CDS094 increments the page counter <code>Y6.P</code> and sets the line counter 
	<code>Y6.L</code> to the maximum lines on the page <code>Y6.MAXL</code> so that the operator does not need to do so in the application.&#160; Application programs should use 
	<code>Y6.P</code> as the page numbers, and <code>Y6.L</code> as the lines left on the page.&#160; 
	If the application program still uses the simple variable <code>L</code> and not 
	<code>Y6.L</code>, 
	then just set <code>L=Y6.MAXL</code> after calling CDS094.&#160; This will insure the 
	maximum lines per page is correct for printing in portrait, landscape, 
	terminals, files, etc.</p>
        <p>Using CDS094 enables a program to work independent of the device being printed to.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Close Printer Logic" />Close Printer Logic</h5>
        <p>When an application is finished and returns the Dynamo Tools menu program 
	CDS001, CDS094 will be called when to close the printer channel if the 
	printer status variable <code>Y6$</code><MadCap:keyword term="CDS084" /> (created by the printer selection routine 
	CDS084) is still in memory.</p>
        <p>When an application must close the printer channel prior to returning to 
	the Dynamo Tools menu, or if the application does not <code>RUN "CDS001"</code> at the 
	end of the job, then the application needs to call CDS094 one more time to complete the 
	printing process.</p>
        <p>&#160;&#160;&#160; <code>CALL "CDS094",Y6$,"E"</code></p>
        <p>The <code>"E"</code> informs CDS094 that you are done using the printer/device.</p>
        <p>When printing to a printer, a form-feed will be sent to the printer causing the last page to be ejected on a laser type printer, or advance to the tear bar on a dot-matrix printer.</p>
        <p>When printing to a display, the operator is prompted so that the last page can be displayed before returning to the menu or other logic within the application.</p>
        <p>When emailing, the <code>FINISH</code> flag of the email log is set to Y, to provide verification that the application sending the email did in fact finish, and so the email is complete.</p>
        <p>When emailing a PDF attachment, CDS094 will call CDS184 to attach the PDF 
	file to the email.</p>
        <p>Note that the printer channel opened to <code>Y6.CH</code> is closed, and 
	<code>Y6$</code> is cleared when CDS094 is called to close the printer.</p>
        <p>When running on a linux, Unix, or AIX server from a PC running facetwin, 
	the user will be asked to display the report file at job completion if the 
	report was printed to a text file or to an Adobe PDF file.&#160; This option 
	requires a Server Share named PRT for the PRT folder on the server where 
	these files are created.</p>
