        <p class="SectionDesc">This program is used to manage users that are working on the same transaction or batch, such as a Purchase Order Receipt or Accounts Payable Invoice batch.&#160; It can be used to prevent updating the transaction or batch while there are still active users working on it.</p>
        <p>These functions are managed using the Dynamo Session Control File CDSM08, so that if sessions are killed, or inactive session records are purged, then the number of users working on the same transaction is automatically reduced.&#160; The application does not need to manage active users.&#160; The Working On field is also displayed in Display System Status.</p>
        <p>Note that these functions are specific to the active company code.</p>
        <p>CDS191 can also be used for debugging Dynaweb applications, background tasks, stored procedures, triggers, etc. by calling CDS191 to set the Working On field.&#160; The Working On field is displayed in the properties page of Display System Status.</p>
        <p>Calling Format:</p>
        <p><code>CALL "CDS191", ERR=XXXX, Y$, ACTION$ {, WORKINGON$ , USERS }</code>
