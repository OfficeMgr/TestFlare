        <p class="SectionDesc">This program is a T Type external routine that can be used to maintain City, State, Zip Code, and Country fields of an address.&#160; It is similar to SW460, but used when there is a separate COUNTRY field in the record in addition to the STATE field.&#160; Specify SW461 as the T type external program for the field with a base name of CITY in the Data Dictionary.&#160; The State, Zip, and Country fields should be omitted from the view, as SW461 will include this fields automatically.</p>
        <p>The fields must have a base field name of CITY, STATE, ZIP, and COUNTRY, with an optional prefix that is the same for each field, i.e., SHIP2CITY, SHIP2STATE, SHIP2ZIP, SHIP2COUNTRY. Any prefix can be used.</p>
        <p>This program will prompt the user for the Zip/Postal code first.</p>
        <p>If a 5 digit or 10 digit US Zip code is entered, then the zip code will be checked against the Dynamo Zip Code database file DYSW01.&#160; If only one record exists in the Zip Code database, then the CITY and STATE fields will be assigned and displayed.&#160; If multiple records exist, the user will be presented a list of the cities that include this zip code, and can select the desired city from the list.&#160; If no matching records exist for the zip code entered, then the operator will be informed that the zip code is not valid.&#160; The Zip Code database file is included in the Dynamo ZIP package.&#160; Use the V menu option to see the date of this package.&#160; The package is distributed quarterly to all systems that participate in the Excellware Priority Support Plan.</p>
        <p>If a Canadian postal code is entered, in the format ANA NAN, then SW461 will automatically assign the Canadian Province code to the STATE field, and CA to the COUNTRY field.</p>
        <p>If no zip/postal code is entered, then the operator may enter a city, state, and country codes.</p>
        <p>See <a href="SW460.htm">SW460</a> when the record includes a STATE field, but not a COUNTRY field.</p>
        <p>Also see <a href="SW022.htm">SW022</a> for complete address validation and correction.</p>
