        <p class="SectionDesc">File Maintenance applications sometimes require special processing before adding a new record, when writing a record, or deleting a record.&#160; When this is required, a Add/Write/Delete program can be specified using the File Maintenance Option withing Data Dictionary Maintenance (FMS).&#160; CDX110 is a non-functioning example of such a routine that could be copied to another program to be used as a shell when an Add/Write/Delete routine is needed.</p>
        <p>The Add/Write/Delete routine has the ability to accept or veto the action.</p>
        <p>For example, if the routine determines that a new record cannot be added, then it should inform the operator, then exit with an error using EXIT 99.</p>
        <p>When writing a record, the routine might determine that changes to the record are required before writing the record.&#160; If this is the case, then the routine should inform the operator, and EXIT 99 back to file maintenance, where the user can make whatever changes are required.</p>
        <p>When deleting a record, the routine might also determine that other data depends on this record, and the delete should not be permitted.&#160; The routine should inform the operator, and EXIT 99 back to file maintenance, which will veto the delete and return to maintenance mode.</p>
        <p>This program is called by File Maintenance, and not typically called by an application program.</p>
