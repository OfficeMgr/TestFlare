        <p class="SectionDesc">This program is used to validate and correct an address.&#160; SW022 is typically specified as a Standard View Validation routine with File Maintenance applications, although it could be called by another Standard View Validation routine.&#160; SW022 calls CDS358 to perform the validation, and will display any fields changed by CDS358.&#160; Note that CDS358 requires the Dynamo Address Correction option to be enabled.&#160; If the Dynamo Address Correction option is enabled, then I for Information Menu Option will include DAC in the list of Licensed Options in the Application Software Information section.</p>
        <p>SW022 submits the address for verification when either a) the name or 
	address fields have changed, or b) there is a field named ADDRCORDATE within 
	the record, and this date is more than 90 days ago, or ADDRCORDATE is zero.</p>
        <p>SW022 will display any corrected address fields in yellow, or in white if the primary text color is yellow.&#160; Other optional fields such as the county code are also displayed if included in the View.</p>
        <p>SW022 will use upper case for the address if there is a NAME field that 
	is mostly upper case, otherwise proper (mixed) case will be used.</p>
        <p>If an address cannot be validated or corrected, then the operator will have the option to revise the address manually, or to accept the address even though it may not be valid.</p>

        <p>SW022 will validate one address in <code>REC$</code>.&#160; The address to be validated will be based on the first data element in the view that ends with 
	<code>"CITY"</code>.&#160; In most cases, the fields in <code>REC$</code> are named CITY, STATE, ZIP, ADDRESS, etc.&#160; However, SW022 can also validate addresses with a prefix before the field names.&#160; For example, a check address could contain fields named CHKCITY, CHKSTATE, CHKZIP, CHKADDRESS, etc., and a Ship To address could contain fields named SHIP2CITY, SHIP2STATE, SHIP2ZIP, SHIP2ADDR1, SHIP2ADDR2, etc.</p>
        <p>If multiple addresses are contained in the same record, then maintain each address in a separate view, so that each address can be validated by the view validation routine that is called by the View Manager when exiting the view.</p>
