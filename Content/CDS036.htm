            <MadCap:keyword term="Records" />This program should be called whenever it is desired to 
extract, write, or remove a record.&#160; It provides an external control file 
for managing extracted records providing information regarding who is using a 
record, and allows the application to write the record without releasing the 
extracted control file record.&#160; CDS036 can also log which records have 
been added, changed, or removed from a file to facilitate file synchronization 
between multiple systems.</p>
        <p>The best reason to use CDS036 instead of coding EXTRACT and WRITE operations 
in an application program, is that the user will be told without any timeout 
delay, if another user has the desired record EXTRACTed.&#160; An example of 
such a message is displayed below.&#160; If you do not use CDS036, then the 
application will get an error 0 without any additional information about what 
user has the record locked.</p>

            <img border="0" src="images/CDS0361.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>The functions that CDS036 provides vary depending on the file type and 
whether there is a template associated with the record.&#160; See table below.&#160; 
The KEYREC$ column indicates whether the application program should call CDS036 
passing the record (<code>REC$</code>) or the key (<code>KEY$</code>).</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Inter-System Communication Log File Maintenance" />Only files listed in the Inter-System Communication Log File Maintenance 
program (ISC menu) with the log indicator set to Y will be logged, even though 
the data record will be written if applicable regardless of this indicator.&#160; The 
indicator that defines a particular system as a headquarters or branch system is 
maintained using Dynamo Configuration Maintenance (SMC menu). Note that if this 
indicator is blank, then no logging will take place.</p>
        <p>Logging requires the length of the data file name to be exactly 6 characters, 
and the maximum length of the key is 32 characters, but the record locking 
mechanism supports file names up to 12 characters long, with the same 32 
character keysize limit.</p>
        <p>If CDS036 cannot perform the <code>WRITERECORD</code> or <code>REMOVE</code> command, then it will 
return to the calling program with <code>ERR</code> set accordingly.</p>
        <p>CDS036 may create two global variables SMS_CDS036_FIL and SMS_CDS036_SEL. 
These globals improve performance by reducing the need to access the ISC control 
files with each call to CDS036.&#160; Theses globals are cleared when accessing the 
appropriate ISC control file maintenance program.&#160; They will be rebuilt the next 
time CDS036 is called.&#160; All other users must logoff to clear these globals when 
changes are made to the control files.</p>

records accessed whether a change was made or not.</h5>

        <h5>Background Tasks</h5>

including a real background task, a dynaweb process, a bbj stored procedure or 
trigger, etc.</p>
        <p>When CDS036 is called from a non-background task to EXTRACT a record, it will 
return the record in use message immediately, and not wait the default 10 
seconds that the EXTRACT continues to retry by default.</p>
        <p>When CDS036 is called from a background task to EXTRACT a record, it will 
continue trying for 60 seconds.&#160; If the record remains locked for 60 
seconds, CDS036 will exit with ERR=0.&#160; In most cases the calling 
application will take the ERR= branch on the CALL to CDS036 and retry the same 
line of code.&#160; The application can change the ERR= to other appropriate 
logic when special handling is needed to handle the situation where the desired 
record is EXTRACTed by another session.</p>
