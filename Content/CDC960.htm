        <p class="SectionDesc">This program is used in conjunction with
<a href="CDC950.htm">CDC950</a> to process the ISC/XXIS20.SSS files received. 
This program may be called or run in the background. It will scan the ISC 
directory for all XXIS20 files and process the data contained in the file. Each 
file is erased once the data is processed.</p>
        <p>CDC960 is typically executed on a branch system at the end of the 
communication session to process the files just received. It is also executed on 
the headquarters system to process files received from the branches.</p>
