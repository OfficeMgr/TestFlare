can be used as a template for applications that use the driver.&#160; You can 
copy and paste this code into an application program.&#160; You can also merge 
lines from this code which is stored as example program CDX010.&#160; Refer to 
the documentation for CDX010 in the Examples section for additional details.</p>
        <p>Warning:&#160; CDS003 assumes that each key in the main file and sort files 
are each of the same length.&#160; You will encounter an error if there is a 
null or short key at the beginning of the file.</p>
        <h5>MultiKeyed (MKY) Files</h5>
        <p>MKY files are supported using <a href="CDS553.htm">CDS553</a> with the new data dictionary.&#160; 
There is also limited support for MKY files using the old data dictionary by 
manually editing program CDLIST33/CDS003.</p>
