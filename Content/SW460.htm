        <p class="SectionDesc">This program is a T Type external routine that can be used to enter a US Zip Code and assign and display the City and State fields based on the information from the Dynamo Zip Code database.&#160; It can also be used to enter a Canadian Postal Code, City, and State/Country Code.&#160; SW460 should be assigned to the CITY field in the Data Dictionary.&#160; The State/Country and Zip fields should be omitted from the View, as SW460 will include those fields below the city field.</p>
        <p>This program will prompt the user for the Zip/Postal code first.</p>
        <p>If a 5 digit or 10 digit US Zip code is entered, then the zip code will be checked against the Dynamo Zip Code database file DYSW01.&#160; If only one record exists in the Zip Code database, then the CITY and STATE fields will be assigned and displayed.&#160; If multiple records exist, the user will be presented a list of the cities that include this zip code, and can select the desired city from the list.&#160; If no matching records exist for the zip code entered, then the operator will be informed that the zip code is not valid.&#160; The Zip Code database file is included in the Dynamo ZIP package.&#160; Use the V menu option to see the date of this package.&#160; The package is distributed quarterly to all systems that participate in the Excellware Priority Support Plan.</p>
        <p>If a Canadian postal code is entered, in the format ANA NAN, then the operator can enter a city name, and should enter C1 as the state/country code.&#160; The province name can be included in the Address Line if desired.</p>
        <p>If no zip/postal code is entered, then the operator may enter a city and state code.</p>
        <p>SW460 should be used when the STATE code is used for US state codes as well as a code for foreign countries.&#160; Data File DISM00 contains the list of State and Country Codes and Names.</p>
        <p>See <a href="SW461.htm">SW461</a> when the record structure includes a COUNTRY code field in addition to the STATE code.</p>
        <p>Also see <a href="SW022.htm">SW022</a> for complete address validation and correction.</p>
